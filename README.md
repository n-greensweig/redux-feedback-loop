# Feedback App

## Project Description

Eval is a feedback app that allows users to submit their experience across several measures for a given day. Eval uses React and Redux to store users' responses in Redux and a PostgreSQL database.

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a database named ```weekend-to-do-app```
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the app to run correctly. The project is built on PostgreSQL, so you will need to have PostgreSQL installed for the app to work. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an ```npm install```
4. Next, run ```npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled``` and ```npm install @mui/icons-material```
5. Run ```npm run server``` in your terminal
6. Run ```npm run client``` in your terminal
7. The ```npm run client``` command will open up a new browser tab for you
